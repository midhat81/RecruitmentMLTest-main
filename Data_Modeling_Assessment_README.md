# Data Modeling Assessment

## 1. Overview
In this assessment, you will demonstrate your ability to work with a dataset (`global_sales.csv`) in a Jupyter or Colab notebook. The final product should be uploaded to a public GitHub repository.

## 2. Assessment Details

1. **Exploration**  
   - **Load the CSV**: Read the dataset into a DataFrame.  
   - **Repo Link**: https://github.com/Impersuasion/RecruitmentDataEng-TransformationTest/blob/main/global_sales.csv
   - **Basic Checks**: Explore the shape of the DataFrame, column names, and data types. Identify any missing or null values and duplicates.

2. **Transformation**  
   - Perform data cleaning if necessary (e.g., dropping/filling missing values, fixing data types).  
   - Create new fields or features if beneficial for the analysis.

3. **Analysis**  
   - Use grouping, aggregations, and/or correlations to draw out key relationships.  
   - Look for trends or patterns relevant to the dataset’s context.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Generate a few plots (e.g., bar charts, line plots, etc.) to highlight key insights.  
   - Provide brief explanations of what each visualization shows.

5. **Documentation**  
   - Write brief Markdown cells throughout your notebook describing your process.  
   - Summarize major takeaways at the end.

## 3. Grading / Evaluation Criteria

- **Data Exploration & Understanding**  
  Demonstrates a systematic approach to reviewing the dataset’s structure, missing values, and overall content.

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Appropriately handles missing values, duplicates, and data types. Any feature engineering or transformations should be justified.

- **Depth of Analysis**  
  Uses relevant techniques (e.g., groupbys, pivot tables, correlations, etc.) to produce meaningful insights.

- **Visualizations**  
  Creates clear, properly labeled plots that effectively communicate findings.

- **Documentation & Communication**  
  Explains each step concisely. Conclusions or recommendations should be stated clearly in the notebook.
